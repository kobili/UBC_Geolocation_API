# UBC_Geolocation_API
A self-made API intended to replace the Geolocation API used in the course project of CPSC 310 2019wT2 at UBC (more info about this project can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/cpsc31019w2/project)

Restores functionality to the Rooms portions of the project (since the original API used has been shut off since the course concluded in April 2020)
